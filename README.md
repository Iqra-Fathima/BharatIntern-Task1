Exciting Insights from My Task 1 Employee Attrition Analysis as part of internship at Bharat Intern

I delved into a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition, shedding light on intriguing trends based on the data taken from Kaggle Here's a snapshot of my key findings:

Attrition by Gender: The maximum attrition is from the male employees, out of total attrition count being 237 we found that 150 is the attrition of male employees.

Job Satisfaction: Our data revealed that male employees tend to exhibit higher job satisfaction compared to their female counterparts.

Attrition by Department: Drilling down into departmental attrition rates, a pattern emerged. The research department experienced the highest attrition, followed by sales and HR departments.

Age and Attrition:
We can observe the prevalence of attrition among employees aged 27-35. This calls for a closer examination of factors influencing career choices and progression within this age bracket.

Marital Status Matters: Strikingly, the data highlighted a correlation between marital status and attrition, with singles exhibiting higher attrition rates. Could this be attributed to a lack of work-life balance or other factors? Addressing the unique needs of single employees might contribute to improved retention outcomes.

Myth Busted: Interestingly, my analysis uncovered a fact about popular belief that "employees leave managers, not companies." I can see that employees who had spent a shorter time with the company exhibited higher attrition, then the employees who had a longer tenure under the same manager.

This insight underscores the vital significance of effective management and team cohesion, suggesting that fostering enduring relationships with managers could play a pivotal role in retaining valued team members.
